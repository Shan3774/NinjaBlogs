# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To run the application 
  ##### clone the repository
  ##### in the terminal run npm install
        this will install all necessary node modules
  ##### in the terminal run npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000 (or any other)
        this will start our json server that provides api end points to interact with the data in db.json file on port 8000
  ##### in another terminal window run `npm start`
        this will kick start your react app on port http://localhost:3000
